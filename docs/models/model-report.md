# Model Report

*A report to provide details on a specific experiment (model) - possibly one of many*

## Analytic Approach

- What is the target (definition)
- What are the inputs (description)
- What kind of model was built?

## Model Description

- Models and Parameters
  - Description or images of data flow graph
    - Training experiment
    - Scoring workflow
  - What learner(s) were used?
  - Learner hyper-parameters

## Results (Model Performance)

- ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate
- Performance graphs for parameters sweeps if applicable

## Model Understanding

- Variable Importance (significance)
- Insight Derived from the Model

## Conclusion and Discussions for Next Steps

- Conclusion
- Discussion on overfitting (if applicable)
- What other Features Can Be Generated from the Current Data
- What other Relevant Data Sources Are Available to Help the Modeling
